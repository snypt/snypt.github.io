# Slack integration

Connecting Slack to your Snypt board allows users to save important resources sent
in Slack channels directly to Snypt. 

To connect slack navigate to the board you want to use and click the apps button in the top right corner.
Click install under Slack. This will navigate you to Slack and ask you to sign into a workspace and grant
Snypt permission to access your data.

## Saving snypts

Now that you have installed Snypt to your workspace you will notice that a Snypt bot has been added to
your workspace. 

Any messages exchanged between users in this workspace that mention the Snypt bot will be analyzed 
and stored to the Snypt board connected to this workspace. Snypt will save multiple urls, colors,
and code. 

For example if I am sending a few lines of code to a team mate and I want this code to be saved
to snypt behind the scenes I would send a code snippet attachment with the message and mention the 
Snypt bot.

If the snypt has been created successfully you should receive message back from the Snypt bot i.e.

```
SNYPT
Saved to My board 
```
