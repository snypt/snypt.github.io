# Saving snypts

This brief tutorial goes through how to save different types of snypts to your board. Snypt currently
supports saving code, color palettes, images, links etc. 

### Saving code

Once you are inside a board you own or have had been added to, click on the **+** icon in the bottom left 
corner. This will bring up a dialog with the option to upload different types of snypts. Select code. This
will bring up a code editing dialog. Here you can add on or more code files of any language. Each
code file can have an optional name which will be used if these files are downloaded later. You can also
select the code language associated with each snypt. Once you've add all the code files you can then add
a note and some tags. 

#### Notes
Adding a **note** to each snypt is helpful because it adds context. If the snypts of code you are uploading
are for a Javascript algorithm to efficiently alphabetize an array you may want to put "_Alphabetizing arrays in JS_".  

#### Tags 
Add tags to a snypt are helpful for search purposes. It makes it easy to search your board for all snypts with 
a particular tag. Tags are also used in community search. If your board is public tags allow other users to more 
easily find your content.
