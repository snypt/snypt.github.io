# Creating a board

Working with Snypt revolves around boards. Boards are a logical collection of snypts. Creating a board is very straight forward. Click on the **_My boards_** link at the top of the navbar.
On your profile page click the **+** icon at the bottom right corner. A dialog will appear prompting 
you to enter some basic information about your board. When you have completed this information click create.

### Adding collaborators

Now that you have created you first board let's add your team mates as collaborators. Open your newly
created board and look in the top right corner for list of collaborators. Click on the add icon which
should bring up a dialog. Here you can search for any existing Snypt users or you can invite new users. 

### Installing Apps

Currently Snypt boards support slack integration. Installing slack allows snypts to saved directly 
from your Slack workspace. For more information go to [ Slack Integration](/docs/slack/integration.md).
